<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Nick here. I spent about 5 years studying all things Biology &amp; Biotechnology and just because you can never run out of things to learn, on one day of the year 2016 I had the brilliant idea to take an online course on R programming.</p>
<p>Next thing I know I was boarding the data science <a href="https://medium.com/p/the-future-of-data-science-14653afb52f5">hype train</a> with no intention of getting off.</p>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt new to computer science or coding, yet my previous encounters with programming languages such as C or Python had been brief and unsuccessful. I was truly surprised by how quickly I was able to not just learn the basics of R, but</p>
<p>become comfortable writing R code to</p>
<p>but mostly to <strong>understand</strong> how R works.</p>
<p>I give it to its more ‚Äúscripting-language‚Äù nature or its</p>
<p>it took me to get hooked up</p>
<p>R things aside, I enjoy</p>
<p>At the time I am writing this, about three years have passed since I created my first <strong>data.frame</strong> and as much as I wish there were some well-thought reasons behind why I decided to make this website, the honest answer it that it just <strong>felt right</strong>.</p>
<p>I write this, about three years have passed by and I just figured it was time to put myself</p>
<p>later, building my own website/portfolio (using R of course!)</p>
<p>Since one can not live only of data science, I do occasionally enjoy other things such as making videos, listening to music and laughing at my phone while watching dog-related memes. Also, as the URL of this blog <em>may</em> suggest, I have a thing for websites that use TLDs in smart and funny way üòú.</p>
