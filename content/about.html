<p>Nick here. I spent about 5 years studying all things Biology &amp; Biotechnology and just because you can never run out of things to learn, on one day of the year 2016 I had the brilliant idea to take an <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming?specialization=jhu-data-science">online course</a> on R programming.</p>
<p>Next thing I know I was boarding the data science <a href="https://medium.com/p/the-future-of-data-science-14653afb52f5">hype train</a> with no intention of getting off.</p>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt new to computer science or coding, yet my previous encounters with programming languages such as C or Python had been brief and unsuccessful. I was truly surprised by how quickly I was able not just to pick up the basics of the R language but become <em>comfortable</em> using R to solve problems and explore datasets (hint: built-in <a href="http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/4/16/vectorization-in-r--why.html">vectorization</a> definitely helped).</p>
<p>At the time I am writing this, about three years have passed since I created my first <em>data.frame</em> and as much as I wish there were some well-thought reasons behind why I decided to make this website, the honest answer it that it just <em>felt right</em>. I guess that after all lurking I eventually wanted to put everything I have learned to some use (building this blog was actually an ‚ÄúR project‚Äù itself, since it was developed within R Studio using the <code>blogdown</code> package.)</p>
<p>Since one can not live only of data science things, I do occasionally enjoy other activities such as making videos, listening to music and laughing at my phone while watching dog-related memes. Also, as the URL of this blog <em>may</em> suggest, I have a thing for websites that use TLDs in smart and funny way üòú.</p>
